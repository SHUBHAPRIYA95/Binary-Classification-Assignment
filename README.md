# Binary-Classification-Assignment
It is a binary classification problem. This problem soleved using neural network.
Dataset: Dataset consist of train and test dataset.For train dataset to be used as validation dataset.For train dataset consist of 3910 records,57 features,1 output.For test dataset consist of 691 records and 57 features.Feaures are X1 to X57 and class 0 and 1.
Data Analysis: Balance the dataset.As the data-set is highly imbalanced, there is a need for us to balance it, in order to get classes to close proximity.
Standardization of Data: We need to standardize the input data set as there are large differences between ranges of each feature.
Splitting the data in train and test into 80:20 and train dataset divided into train and validation into 4:1.
Model Building:We can specify the number of neurons in the layer as the first argument and specify the activation function using the activation argument.So neural network is built.
Model Training: Compiling the model.We are considering optimizer as “Adam” it is an optimization algorithm that can be used. Mainly in Adam, individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients are calculated.
Model Evaluation: Epochs vs Accuracy graph is as plotted and Epochs vs Loss graph plotted.
Conclusion:A deep learning model to is built with for binary classification.
